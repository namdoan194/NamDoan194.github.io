### SUPPERVISED LEARNING 

**CREDIT CARD DEFAULT**
1. Project Describtion: I am trying to build different classification models to predict default and non-default borrowers. The attributes include: Loan_Type, Degree, Income, Credit_Score, Loan_Length, Gender, Signers, and Citizenship
<br><br>
There are a lot of questions that the project can help me answer, but I would like to mention some questions here:
<br><br>
**_Which gender will likely default the payment?**
According to the graph, the gender is not the main impact of credit card default. However, this project shows that higher number of female will likely default the payment than male do.

<br><br>
**_Will level of income affect the default payment?**
Not really. Some of people with annual salary of $100k still default their payments

<br><br>
**_Will the credit score be the main factor to decide if the borrowers will not be able to return the money?**
Not Really. In the graph, the large majority of people with low credit score do not miss any payment

3. Machine Learning: Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, Naives Bayes, and Random Forest Classifier
<br><br>
5. Outcome: Among 5 different models, Random Forest Classifier has the best performance with the acuracy score of 94% and ROC_score of 0.507.

**PREDICTION ON HOUSE PRICE IN BOSTON**
1. Project Description: I am trying to build linear regression model to predict the house price in Boston area. The attributes includes: Taxi distance, Market distance, Hospital Distance, Carpet area, Builtup area, Parking type, City type, and Rainfall.
<br><br>

<br><br>
2. Machine Learning: Simplie and Multiple Linear Regression 
<br><br>
<img src="images/Actual vs Predicted on Training.png?raw=true"/>
<br><br>
3. Outcome: There are three attributes that hugely correlate with the house price
